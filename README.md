# js-practice

Answers to various programming problems in JavaScript.

I've been doing programming exercises from various places to brush up on my
JavaScript and as a coding warm up at the beginning of the day. I've decided to
upload my solutions here for the heck of it.

## Exercise Sources

### [Eloquent JavaScript][eloquentjs] - Marijn Haverbeke

Great beginner's introduction to JS and some Computer Science concepts. The
online version of the book has exercises complete with code sandboxes at the
end of each chapter. Great for beginners, but the problems are also good quick warmup practice.
